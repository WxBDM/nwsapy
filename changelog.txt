- Requests wasn't added as a dependency for the package, and in a fresh install this caused errors.

    - points
        - nwsapy.get_point()
        - nwsapy.get_point_station()
    - glossary
        - nwsapy.get_glossary()
- Documentation has been rebuilt and reorganized to make navigation easier.

- Added to_pint() to select endpoint objects.
- An iterable class has been added to utilities to allow for scalability across endpoint groups.

v1.0.1 (release: Feb 16, 2022)
- BUG: Fixed an issue where `point` endpoint wasn't working.
- BUG: Fixed an issue where all alerts didn't have individual alerts.
- Removed the __repr__ for the point endpoint, to be implmeented at a later time.
- Updated README with a proper example.
- Updated GitHub issue tags.

v1.0.0 (release: Jan 2, 2022)
The entire application on the back-end was re-written to be more structured.
The reasons are as follows:
- Easier integration and module test writing.
- Easier to identify bugs due to the package's modularity.
- Users can extract specific functionality in the package for other projects.
- Quicker development and implementation of new/depreciated NWS API endpoints.

The changes are as follows:
- The license has been changed to Apache 2.0.
- Documentation has been re-written to a readthedocs theme from numpy/google theme.
- Project structure has been reorganized:
    nwsapy/
    ├── core/
    ├── endpoints/
    ├── services/
    ├── entrypoint.py

- Added `api_connector` to the initial import statement (i.e. from nwsapy import api_connector)
- Removal of the following endpoint `get_*` methods due to depreciation/removal
from NWS API:
    - get_point_station
- Removal of a keyword argument for ``get_all_alerts`` due to NWS API depreciation:
    - active
- Some functionality (such as a list for the parameter for the alert endpoint) 
    is no longer available due to the migration to a new structure.

v0.2.1 (release: June 20, 2021)
- BUG: requests wasn't a dependency. This has been added and a fresh install can be made in venv.

v0.2.0 (release: June 16, 2021)
- The following endpoint groups (with nwsapy methods) have been implemented:
    - points
        - nwsapy.get_point()
        - nwsapy.get_point_station()
    - glossary
        - nwsapy.get_glossary()
- Documentation has been rebuilt and reorganized to make navigation easier.
- Added make_request() to allow for the user to make their own requests. There are niche uses for this.
- Added a to_dict() method to individual alerts and points.
- Added to_pint() to select endpoint objects.
- An iterable class has been added to utilities to allow for scalability across endpoint groups.
- Unittests has been introduced to help increase code quality and ensure code integrity.
- `filter_by()` has been removed. This has been replaced by parameters being read into the nwsapy method.
- .effective_utc, .send_utc, etc has been introduced as a new attribute for alerts
- As a result, to_utc() has been removed from alerts.
- Removed .multipoint from alerts.
- Removed private variable `_count` for all alert objects. Has no purpose.
- Removed data class from alerts. Why was this there? The world may never know.

v0.1.0 (release: May 17, 2021)
- Documentation follows how Pandas documentation is laid out.
- Alerts module is implemented in it's full.
- Documentation is put on readthedocs
- Uploaded to pypi

Last updated: 6/21/21

v0.2.2 (release: TBD)
- BUG: API had MultiPolygon for alerts.
    - APy handles this by giving a list for polygons, and a nested list for points.
- BUG: Series data types are correct now, there's no reformatting as in previous versions.
- BUG: get_alert_by_id wasn't iterable. This has been fixed.

v0.2.1 (release: June 20, 2021)
- BUG: requests wasn't a dependency. This has been added and a fresh install can be made in venv.

v0.2.0 (release: June 16, 2021)
- The following endpoint groups (with nwsapy methods) have been implemented:
    - points
        - nwsapy.get_point()
        - nwsapy.get_point_station()
    - glossary
        - nwsapy.get_glossary()
- Documentation has been rebuilt and reorganized to make navigation easier.
- Added make_request() to allow for the user to make their own requests. There are niche uses for this.
- Added a to_dict() method to individual alerts and points.
- Added to_pint() to select endpoint objects.
- An iterable class has been added to utilities to allow for scalability across endpoint groups.
- Unittests has been introduced to help increase code quality and ensure code integrity.
- `filter_by()` has been removed. This has been replaced by parameters being read into the nwsapy method.

- As a result, to_utc() has been removed from alerts.
- Removed .multipoint from alerts.

This document describes the changelog for all the different versions.

Last updated: 6/10/21

v0.2.0 (release: TBD)
- Added a to_dict() method to individual alerts and points.
- `points` has been added: nwsapy.get_point(lat, lon) and nwsapy.get_point_stations(lat, lon).
    - Pint was added in (to_pint()). This changes select units in all points objects.
- `filter_by()` for alerts has been severely built upon:
    - Includes data type checking to ensure that the data types are correctly formatted.
    - Allows you to filter based upon the attributes in the individual objects.
    - When called, it will give a copy of the object, following what pandas does with dataframes.
        - This means filter_by() does not return a list.
        - To keep it backwards compatible, all endpoint objects are iterable.
- .effective_utc, .send_utc, etc has been introduced as a new attribute for alerts
- Removed to_utc() from alerts.
- Removed .multipoint from alerts.
- Test, test, tests! Lots of tests have been introduced to increase the code quality.
- nwsapy.get_glossary() has been implemented. That was easy! *knocks on wood*
- Removed private variable `_count` for all alert objects. Has no purpose.
- Removed data class from alerts. Why was this there? The world may never know.

v0.1.0 (release: May 17, 2021)
- Documentation follows how Pandas documentation is laid out.
- Alerts module is implemented in it's full.
- Documentation is put on readthedocs
- Uploaded to pypi

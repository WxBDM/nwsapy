Alert Error
===========

Introduction: Alert Error
-------------------------
One of the biggest advantages of NWSAPy is that it is designed to reduce the number of errors. Namely, 404 errors regarding URL construction, as well as parameter data type/structure. As such, you shouldn't see error objects on a regular basis. However, they are possible to get due to rate limit or request time out.

For reference, the link for a description of the HTTP errors are here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status
